My Own Dumb Language

Built by following @munificent's [great guide](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

Run the interpreter, call "use test;" then ~~"fibo 5;" to see the extremely exciting value of the fifth element in the fibonacci sequence!~~ `f! !` to show resolution works, but I broke recursion in some patch and now need to figure out how to unbreak it.
